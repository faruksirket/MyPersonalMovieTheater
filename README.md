### A simple project for The Movie DB based on swift MVVM pattern.  

I was searching several tableView examples to practice and I decided to make simple movie app using [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/). I’m still beginner to swift, so my lovely output might not get many ⭐️ , but could help some of iOS beginners like me

If you want to know the details about the project, Please go to [MyMedium](https://medium.com/doyeona/mvvm-simple-tableview-with-movie-app-in-swift-53debe109170) for more details!
